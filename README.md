The Mightiest Repository

Hello world! I started my journey in health care with the Army as a medic, eventually becoming a civilian EMT. I love my job,
and I'll probably continue to be an EMT for the rest of my life. As a career choice, however, it's falling a little (a lot) 
short of paying the bills! So I've decided to look into the cyber community for a new, challenging career that will keep
me on my toes, and give me enough money at the end of the month to enjoy some time with my family! I look forward to learning
from you, and possible working with you!
